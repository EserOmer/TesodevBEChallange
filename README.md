# TesodevBEChallange
Objective:
The objective is to create an order application for TESODEV’s business requirements.

Goals:
TESODEV needs a micro service implementation for order and customer domains. We need to apply two
simple micro service for the customers and orders which should be easy to use and robust for frequent
usage. In this project, the main goal is to understand the ability of backend architecture and micro service
knowledge.

Solution:
Class diagram for the customers and orders are given below. You should communicate two micro services via
gateway and create CRUD endpoints.

Project Outline:
• Project can be done in any frameworks and languages (C#, Javascript, Python, Go etc.).
• While creating database, any database service can be used (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.).
• While writing endpoints, http status codes, http methods, request models and response models should be
considered.
• Validation should be written for request models.
• Unit tests should be written where necessary.
